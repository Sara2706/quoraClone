    "body": "Tumbadd flopped at the box office, and even though it has earned a cult status ever since its release, it did not make good money when it was released in theatres. Why? The same reason why movies like Andaz Apna Apna, Swadesh, Tamasha, and even a Hollywood movie like Fight Club flopped. When people walk into the theatre, they want instant entertainment. They do not want to think deeply and invest their minds into the story. This is why some of the best gems of cinema remain underrated. Luckily, Tumbadd got its share of popularity some years after its release, and today, everyone recognizes it as one of the best movies of this generation.",
